# Heart Disease Prediction Using Logistic Regression
## Objective: This project aims to develop a Logistic Regression model for accurate heart disease prediction. By analyzing medical data, the model identifies individuals at high risk, enabling early intervention and improved patient outcomes. The goal is to create a user-friendly tool that can be widely adopted to enhance public health and reduce the burden of heart disease.

## Introduction : 
### Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are a major health concern, often leading to severe complications and even death. Early detection is crucial for effective treatment and prevention. Traditional diagnosis methods can be time-consuming and less accurate. Machine learning offers a promising solution to improve the accuracy and efficiency of CVD prediction. By analyzing complex interactions between risk factors, machine learning models can help identify individuals at high risk, enabling timely intervention and potentially saving lives.

## Problem Statement : 
### Early detection of heart disease is crucial for effective treatment. Logistic Regression can analyze medical data to predict an individual's risk. This predictive model helps healthcare professionals identify high-risk patients early on, enabling timely interventions and improving patient outcomes.

### Software Used :
-  Jupyter Notebook

## Working : 


## Conclusion : 

### I invite further research to explore the limitations and potential enhancements of this system.
