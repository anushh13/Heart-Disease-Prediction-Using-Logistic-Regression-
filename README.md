# Heart Disease Prediction Using Logistic Regression
## Objective: This project aims to develop a Logistic Regression model for accurate heart disease prediction. By analyzing medical data, the model identifies individuals at high risk, enabling early intervention and improved patient outcomes. The goal is to create a user-friendly tool that can be widely adopted to enhance public health and reduce the burden of heart disease.

## Introduction : 
### Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are a major health concern, often leading to severe complications and even death. Early detection is crucial for effective treatment and prevention. Traditional diagnosis methods can be time-consuming and less accurate. Machine learning offers a promising solution to improve the accuracy and efficiency of CVD prediction. By analyzing complex interactions between risk factors, machine learning models can help identify individuals at high risk, enabling timely intervention and potentially saving lives.

## Problem Statement : 
### Early detection of heart disease is crucial for effective treatment. Logistic Regression can analyze medical data to predict an individual's risk. This predictive model helps healthcare professionals identify high-risk patients early on, enabling timely interventions and improving patient outcomes.

### Software Used :
-  Jupyter Notebook

## Working : 
1.Data Preprocessing: The framingham.csv dataset is loaded and preprocessed.
Unnecessary columns are dropped, and missing values are handled.
Data is scaled using StandardScaler to ensure features have a similar scale.

2.Data Splitting: The dataset is divided into training and testing sets. The training set is used to train the model, while the testing set is used to evaluate its performance. Â  
Model Building:

3.Logistic Regression:A Logistic Regression model is created.
The model is trained on the training data.
It learns the relationship between the input features (age, sex, medical parameters) and the target variable (presence or absence of heart disease).

4.Random Forest:
A Random Forest classifier is created.
This model is also trained on the training data.
It builds multiple decision trees and combines their predictions to improve accuracy.
Model Evaluation:

5.Accuracy: The accuracy of both models is evaluated using metrics like Jaccard similarity score.
Confusion Matrix: A confusion matrix is used to visualize the model's performance in terms of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
Classification Report: A classification report provides detailed metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and support for each class.

## Conclusion : 

### I invite further research to explore the limitations and potential enhancements of this system.
